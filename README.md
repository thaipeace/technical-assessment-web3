# Engineering Assessment

## 📝 Objective

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to:

Work with Web3 technologies and integrate blockchain functionality into a decentralized application (dApp).

---

## 📌 Task Instructions

1. **Create a New API Endpoint**

   - Add a new API endpoint in `index.js` named:

     ```
     [Name]ApiTest
     ```

2. **Smart Contract Interaction**

   - Select any **pre-deployed** or **public smart contract** (mainnet or testnet).
   
   - Fetch some data (any useful information such as balance, contract state, or public variables).
   
   - The logic should fetch data through your new API endpoint.


3. **Output**

   - The result should be printed to the console.
   - No need for complex UI or data persistence 
   - just demonstrate that the data was fetched successfully.

---

## 📤 Submission

Once completed, submit one of the following:

- **short video** recording your work.
- **screenshots** showing the API call and console result.
- **Github Link** where your assessment result were pushed.

---

## ⏰ Time Expectation

- Estimated time to complete: **30–60 minutes**.

---

## ⚙️ Notes

You may use any blockchain provider such as:

  - **ethers.js**
  - **web3.js**
  - Any public RPC provider (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode, etc.)
  
Keep your code **clean, simple, and easy to review**.

Handle errors gracefully where possible.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

To run the project locally:

# Clone the repository (if provided)
git clone [repo-url]

# Move into the project directory
cd [project-folder]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start


============================
ANSWER:

Uses ethers.js to read public state from the USDC token contract on Ethereum mainnet:
Contract: 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48
Fetches: name, symbol, decimals, totalSupply

How to run
npm run dev
# or
node src/index.js

You can also call the endpoint manually:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/AdminApiTest

Output
```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "contract": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
    "network": "ethereum-mainnet",
    "name": "USD Coin",
    "symbol": "USDC",
    "decimals": 6,
    "totalSupply": "51993107797.514184"
  }
}
```
